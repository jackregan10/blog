# Simple Clean — Static Site

This is a minimal, content-first static website built with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It's designed to match the clean single-column style you provided earlier.

## Files

- `index.html` — home / posts list
- `about.html` — centered about page with portrait
- `post-sample.html` — sample single post page
- `css/style.css` — styles
- `js/main.js` — small script to toggle mobile nav
- `assets/portrait-placeholder.png` — placeholder image

## Deploy

You can host this on GitHub Pages by creating a repo and pushing these files to the `main` branch. Enable Pages in the repo settings and set the source to the `main` branch (root).

## Customize

Edit HTML files directly, or replace with your own generator (Jekyll, Eleventy, etc.).
