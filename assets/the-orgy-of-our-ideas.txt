<h1>The Orgy of Our Ideas</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">"A person who won't read has no advantage over one who can't read."<br> - Mark Twain</p>

<p>I recently came across an essay lamenting the shortcomings of modern literature. More
specifically, the coddled mind of the contemporary reader. The former AP Literature
teacher <a href="https://donbeck1.substack.com/p/stop-reading-novels-like-a-child" target="_blank"
title="Substack Essay">argued</a> that today’s popular prose only affords entertainment
while the time-tested classics are testaments to a lost art of nuanced, provocative, and
thoughtful reading. In their difficulty, the classics provoke greater mental tumult,
creating an additive influence beyond consuming the reader’s attention. Simply put not all
reading is equal. This sparked a larger question that has been lingering in the background
of my life for some time.</p>

<p>I enjoy reading. Easy and hard reading, I enjoy it; but many people don’t. My friends
and family often suggest reading to be a waste of time, yet others consume books at a clip
even faster than me. While I was encouraged by the sentiment, I was unsatisfied by the
aforementioned essay at responding to my critics. Why specifically do words on a page
offer more potent self-actualizing discovery than a film, conversation, or podcast? If
it’s the type of books that we read, what’s different about a YouTube video dissecting the
author’s ideas? Or picking from the constant stream of Substack articles distilling their
philosophical themes in 2,000-word soundbites. I wanted an answer that didn’t respond to
the why with just the what.</p>


<p>Especially at my current stage of life, well defined with Kegan’s interpretation of the
socialized mind, in which he <a href="https://mindsatwork.com/blog/evolve-interview-with-dr-
robert-kegan/" target="_blank" title="Interview with Dr. Robert Kegan">describes</a> how the
contrarian perspective to productivity is a hard one to stomach. And the numerous
documented health benefits of reading didn’t feel like an adequate response either. Given
the dangerous habits of my dietary choices, one mustn’t look far before pointing out the
contradiction in offering health as an excuse to pursue a certain direction in my
life.</p>

<p>I also wanted a response to the most efficient and optimized of readers. Those who hold
the Wall Street Journal as the grail of compelling prose. While there’s nothing wrong with
remaining up to date on the obnoxiously over stimulating flow of current events, I would
guess Journal readers have a hard time recalling their favorite article from two weeks
prior.</p>

<p>And no, I refuse to believe that reading has to be some majestic confession to the
human condition where our books can be written off as an “art.” That’s too easy. There is
something more to the desire to read, something satisfying to the optimizers and
compelling to the attention-lacking, new media obsessed crowd alike.</p>

<p>Matt Ridley <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90186410/frog-design-when-ideas-have-
sex" target="_blank" title="When Ideas Have Sex">writes</a> that “ideas have sex.” He
understood the progression of human innovation was intimately tied to our capacity for
exchange and iteration. Unlike chimpanzees, we share ideas and build on top of them. Our
capacity for cooperative thinking is what powers innovation, not simply our spontaneous
genius. While in the micro sense it seems obvious that the chair gave rise to the couch,
the full gravity of his argument bares its head when we understand innovation on a larger
scale.</p>

<p>I’m talking about the societal systems that govern our world at massive proportions but
remain hidden behind layers of complexity. Global commodities trading, air travel,
vaccines, water insecurity, global warming, etc. The efficient solutions to these grand
systems are found through many generations of reproducing ideas. Much like how natural
selection self-selects the best hereditary makeup, the best idea rises to the top of the
pile.</p>

<p>Unconventional but well integrated ideas produce unusual mutations that give birth to
our society’s greatest inventions. Velcro was invented by Swiss engineer George de Mestral
after a walk in the woods gave rise to a realization about the hooks of a cocklebur.
American electrical engineer Percy Spencer was developing radar technology during WWII
when he noticed a candy bar in his pocket melted, leading to the commercial microwave
oven. Adhesive tape was originally a biproduct of an adhesive design for space flight and
was largely unnoticed until a church choir member saw its application to keep paper notes
attached to their hymnal. We’ve had the Post-it note ever since. Ideas are an iterative
yet additive process.</p>

<p>Serendipity may be the excuse we claim to tie a neat bow on a story that leads to world
changing innovation, but I suppose we shouldn’t let humanity off so easy. Do we want to
wait for global warming’s solution to pop into someone’s head as they drive their Tesla
along the Pacific coast of Nevada? The additive quality of innovation produces an
uncomfortable responsibility to initiate the foreplay of our ideas. We all possess this
deeply personal charge to human innovation and our ideas’ ever-widening evolutionary
tree.</p>

<p>The blank slate of ink on paper opens the human consciousness to imagination. The
intimate setting where ideas reproduce. No other media offers the same limited direction
and breadth of restrictions that a book offers.</p>

<p>In his posthumously published collection of essays <em>My Belief</em>, Hesse <a
href="https://archive.org/details/mybeliefessayson0000hess/page/n1/mode/2up"
target="_blank" title="Hermann Hesse, My Belief">writes</a> of the impermanence of books
in the face of new technologies and tempting entertainment mediums. He believed that the
formulation of words and their translations in writing offers “the only means by which
humanity can have a history and a continuing consciousness of itself.” Without books,
ideas would lose the keys to the sleazy Motel 6 or Waikiki honeymoon suite where they like
to make such sweet, sweet love.</p>

<p>My point deserves one extreme caveat to the casual reader. Simply drawing one’s eyes
across a page is not enough to allow this exchange to manifest. I believe the
misconception of the reading pessimist and the bane of the performative reader’s existence
lies in the necessity for critical and active reading. Reading alone is a passive act. As
such, writing is indispensable from true, purposeful reading. One must digest its contents
and consummate its ideas to produce the elusive value of reading that is lost in the
observations of the passers-by.</p>

<p>This projection of our own ideas on to the words we read is essential but an incredibly
vulnerable and private experience. When we shy away from the confident pessimist who hides
behind the social superiority of their productivity it is because we desire to give the
necessary privacy to the orgy of our ideas.</p>

<p>When others ask why I read, whether it be a classic novel, a searing indictment of our
contemporary culture, or even a tasteless fantasy the answer is always: for the benefit of
ideas. Writing remains the undefeated grounds by which we can exchange ideas, allow them
to reproduce in our imaginative domains, and innovate the next generation defining
systems.</p>

<p>Next time someone tells you that reading is boring, or worse, a waste of time, smile
and settle confidently back into your imaginative state and allow the ideas to vigorously
reproduce in your head. There is no greater material value than in the master bedroom of
innovation taking place at the intersection of the page, your consciousness, and a pencil.
We readers revel not in what the words distract us from but in the abundance they
create.</p>
