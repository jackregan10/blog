<p>I am a third year undergraduate, pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at
Duke University.</p>

<p>Mortimer Adler of the University of Chicago  <a
href="https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1940jul06-00011/" target="_blank"
title="Mortimer Adler, How to Mark a Book">wrote</a> that a true reader should "write
between the lines". He believed that in effect, reading is passive and produces nothing
beyond entertainment for the reader. Through his philosophy, marking up a
book was indispensable from reading. This webpage is an attempt to live by Adler's
philosophy. I am in search of a heavier grasp on the words that I read. My 2026 plan is to
share my thinking and the thinking of others that I believe present credibility or a
noticeably strong connection to their reality.</p>

<p>This page is an experiment. I may take it down tomorrow; though, I hope not.</p>
