<h1>Things I've Read, and Think you Should Too</h1>

<p><i>Never Let Me Go, Kazuo Ishiguro</i></p> <p>A crushing fiction exploring friendship
and loss through the lens of memory. Ishiguro beautifully elicits the terrifying yet
addicting nature of nostalgia as the narrator reflects from her deathbed. An example of
how the written word can elicit emotion in ways you didn't think possible.</p>

<p><i>Flowers for Algernon, Daniel Keyes</i></p> <p>A unique attempt at the coming-of-age
story that forces the reader to wrestle with their competing priorities. Keyes creatively
defines growing old as a conflict between the collective experience of love and the
individual pursuit of intelligence.</p>

<p><i>The Year of Magical Thinking, Joan Didion</i></p> <p>My favorite written account of
depression. Didion writes a haunting interpretation of the obsession and disorientation
that consumes us in the face of loss. This book created an instinctual hole in my
stomach.</p>

<p><i>The Fourth Turning</i>, Neil Howe and William Strauss</i></p> <p>A seminal history
of the American empire told through a cyclic clock. The authors categorize world events
into four saeculum that repeat with similar characteristics in each new generation. As an
experimental historical horoscope, this nonfiction will help you understand how
generational behaviors can predict the future.</p>
