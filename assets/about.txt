<p>I am a third-year undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
from Duke University.</p>

<p>Mortimer Adler of the University of Chicago <a
href="https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1940jul06-00011/" target="_blank"
title="Mortimer Adler, How to Mark a Book">wrote</a> that a true reader should not only
read between the lines but also write between the lines. He believed that reading was passive
and in practice only produced entertainment. His philosophy professed that marking up a
book was indispensable from the productive act of reading. This webpage is an attempt to
live by Adler's philosophy. To read with a pencil in my hand. Ultimately, I am in search
of a heavier grasp on the words that I read. My 2026 plan is to share my thinking and the
thinking of others that I believe present credibility or a noticeably strong connection to
their reality. </p>
