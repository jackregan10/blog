<h1>Davies Law of Commodities</h1>

<p> Allow me to begin with one of my favorite aphorisms: <a
href="https://backofmind.substack.com/p/surprises-and-how-to-spot-them" target="_blank"
title="Davies Law">Davies Law</a>. “If you don’t make predictions, you’ll never know what
to be surprised by.” In an abundantly predicted world, it’s important to remember what
purpose predictions hold. It is to think, to will failure, and above all else, to learn
from your disappointment. So, while I admit many prediction justifications appear trivial
- especially when posed by subject matter amateurs - without such effort, there would be
no context with which to understand our world. </p>

<p> I recently finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Sale-Javier-
Blas/dp/0190078952" target="_blank" title="Amazon Book Listing"> The World for Sale </a>,
Blas and Farchy’s far-reaching investigation into the twisted world of commodities
trading. While reading about its history, I was most compelled by the concept of a
commodity supercycle. Most recently experienced as the China boom, which peaked in 2011
with oil prices at $101.80 per barrel, the commodity market has been <a
href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/what-is-a-commodity-super-cycle/" target="_blank"
title="Cyclical Pattern"> shown </a> to hold a cyclical nature of vast, volatile swings in
unison between commodity assets. This spectacle reflects humanity’s curious tendency to
inadvertently generate patterns, a phenomenon I find deeply fascinating. After many years
of low, stable prices, the global commodities market is poised to swing back in the
positive direction. The question I hope to reflect on is: why now? </p>

<p> A supercycle is defined as a prolonged period in which prices outstrip their long-run
trends. Historically, these occurrences track three universal qualities: supply-side
constraints, demand-side drivers, and monetary influences. That being said, no two
supercycles exhibit the same behavior. While structurally similar, they are differentiated
by their macro stimuli. The 1913 peak was preceded by the Industrial Revolution; in 1973,
the world experienced a massive post-WWII reconstruction effort; and most recently, in the
early 2000s, the meteoric industrialization and urbanization of the People’s Republic of
China. I suspect the next supercycle will be historically characterized by the expansion
of the carbon-neutral economy. </p>

<p> Oil leads the pack of commodities with the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-
content/uploads/2016/11/boc-review-autumn16-buyuksahin.pdf" target="_blank" title="Oil
Elasticity"> highest </a> price elasticity of global output growth. However, in a carbon-free economy, we would expect the use of oil and other fossil fuels to dramatically
decrease in deference to renewable energy technology. This structural shift delivers
metals to the core of the next global supercycle. </p>

<p> Supply-side constraints begin with shovels in the ground, <a
href="https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/supply-chains-struggle-as-energy-
transition-drives-surging-demand-for-metals-bloombergnef-finds/" target="_blank"
title="Supply Constraints"> where </a> key metals like copper and graphite are
experiencing significant supply shortages and lagging mining investments. Additionally,
upstream refining capabilities for metals remain squarely dominated by the Chinese, an
increasingly authoritarian environment threatening global supply chains. Given the often
decade-long upstart requirements for new mining and refining infrastructure, these
limitations are unlikely to remedy amid a much faster rise in metals demand. </p>

<p> We will likely see the supply-and-demand struggle play out first in Australia. Much of
Australia’s legacy coal-powered energy production is <a
href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/energy/renewable" target="_blank" title="Australia's Coal
Production"> expected </a> to go offline in 2030. A climate well suited for renewable
energy, combined with the liberal government’s pledge toward a carbon-free economy and the
nation’s <a href="https://www.azomining.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=45#:~:t
ext=Australia:%20A%20Leader%20in%20the,the%20global%20production%20of%20minerals."
target="_blank" title="Australia's Mining Outlook"> stance </a> as the fifth-largest
mining power in the world (particularly in metals) supports the idea that Australia will
drive the next boom. </p>

<p> For almost a decade, <a href="https://news.csu.edu.au/opinion/ross-garnaut-thinks-
australia-can-become-a-low-carbon-superpower-clive-hamilton-is-not-convinced"
target="_blank" title="Ross Garnaut"> Ross Garnaut </a> has championed the idea that
Australia is well positioned to lead the globe in renewable energy. His writing has been
met with skepticism due to lofty financing expectations and overshooting the industry's
ability to bridge the energy gap between fossil fuels and renewables. However, Australia’s
2024–25 budget and the 'Future Made in Australia' campaign set a clear precedent that the
Australian policy body is on board with the transition. Having committed $22.7 billion
over the next decade, Australia is on its way to achieving net- zero emissions, aiming to
become a global energy superpower by 2050. </p>

<p> Lastly, 2025 has brought a new explosion in the financialization of rare earths,
primarily in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-silver-2025-multiple-
record-133600639.html" target="_blank" title="Silver and Gold"> gold</a>. In an
unprecedented year of military conflicts, international disillusion, and upending of the
current world order, the dollar’s dominance has endured deep <a

title="Weakening Dollar">fissures</a>.  Compared to other currencies, the US dollar has
seen its largest decline in 50 years. These circumstances have given rise to renewed
interest in rare metals as a hedge against inflation, spurring massive spikes in gold <a
href=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGVZ/" target="_blank" title="CBOE">
volatility</a>. With recent developments between Fed Chair Jerome Powell and President
Trump’s crusade to pull rates lower, the future of the dollar faces even greater domestic
uncertainty. In addition to driving inflation upward, lower rates would carry the
substantial byproduct of increased speculative spending, further fueling renewable
infrastructure development. </p> <p> The commodities market is especially exposed to a
weakened dollar, as most trading is priced in USD. Historical data shows an inverse <a
href="https://www.parametricportfolio.com/-/media/Files/Insights-and-Research/Commodity-
Prices-and-the-Strength-of-the-US-Dollar/Evil-Twins_Commodity-Prices-and-the-Strength-of-
the-USD-2021.ashx" target="_blank" title="USD and Commodities"> relationship</a> between
the price of commodities and the strength of the dollar. This historic fall in dollar
value is likely to reflect a reciprocal historic rise in commodity prices. </p>

<p> One of the biggest hurdles the carbon-neutral economy will face in the coming years is
the political environment, particularly the role of the United States as a world climate
leader. President Trump has been an outspoken supporter of traditional energy sources and
the catalyst behind the cancellation of several offshore wind farm projects. Furthermore,
his controversial fiscal spending package is poised to slash multiple renewable energy
subsidies. To this obstacle, I offer two responses. First, Trump and his anti-climate
initiatives will largely depart with the end of his term. Despite his flashy exit from the
Paris Agreement, the rest of the world’s climate projects remain largely <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/09/a-colossal-own-goal- trumps-
exit-from-global-climate-treaties-will-have-little-effect-outside-us" target="_blank"
title="World Climate Initiatives"> unbothered</a>. Second, the decision-making behind
future renewable projects will continue to follow the money. As of last year, 91% of
renewable <a href="https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Jul/91-Percent-of-New-
Renewable- Projects-Now-Cheaper-Than-Fossil-Fuels-Alternatives" target="_blank"
title="Smart Econmics"> projects </a> commissioned in 2024 were more cost-effective than
any new fossil fuel alternatives. Even a divisive political environment won’t sway the
momentum of smart economics. </p>
